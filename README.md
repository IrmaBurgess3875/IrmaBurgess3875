## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my journey as a junior game designer learning C# scripting and level design in Unity. This space serves as a personal sandbox for building small games, experimenting with mechanics, and developing the foundational skills needed to bring interactive worlds to life.

As someone new to game development, my focus is on learning the core building blocks of Unityâ€”from writing clean, functional C# scripts to understanding how to create engaging and intuitive level layouts. Iâ€™m especially interested in how code and design work together to shape player experience, pacing, and gameplay flow.

Inside this repository, youâ€™ll find a mix of prototypes, mechanics demos, and level design experiments. Iâ€™m currently working on player movement, camera controls, basic AI, triggers, and UI elements, while also exploring Unityâ€™s physics, lighting, and prefab systems. Each project is a stepping stone, helping me get more comfortable with the engine and scripting logic.

Alongside code and scenes, I include notes, breakdowns, and sometimes visual references to explain the design choices and challenges behind each feature or level. My goal is not just to build working games, but to develop a deeper understanding of what makes gameplay satisfying and immersive.

Whether youâ€™re also learning Unity or just curious about the process, I hope you find this repository helpful, insightful, or at least a little inspiring. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, ideas, or collaborationâ€”thereâ€™s so much to learn, and the game dev community is one of the most creative and supportive spaces out there.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore or fork any of the projects as I continue to grow my skills in game design and development.
